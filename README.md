# Social-Network-API

## Description

The goal of this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

I learnt how to:

- Create API routes to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE using Express
- Create a a MongoDB database and ODM
- To use Insomnia to test the API routes
